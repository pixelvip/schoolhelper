SchoolHelper is a Web App trying to simplify Organization and Learning in Schools for Students like me. The key part here: All the data will be synchronized with class members. This will make it much more time efficient, to stay up to date with the material in class.

I'm currently working on following Modules:
- Schedule
- Agenda
- Settings
- Learn
- Grades

Previews:
